#TODO list

- Add context menus for ace, contextmenu.js
- Add option and binding (with debounce) for showing type on cursor activity (make sure not in call before sending request to tern)
- find a way to update jshint options for entire project, the state.maxerrors default is 100, and its way too low
- Add find refs
- add caching of auto show type so it doesnt have to keep calling tern for type info (just like arg hints)
